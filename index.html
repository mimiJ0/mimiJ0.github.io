                <h2>The Hate</h2>
                    <p>Most people are scared of pigeons as they believe they are dirty and carry diseases, this myth most likely came after world war II.</p>
                    <p>Because they live near humans and leave their droppings everywhere and travel in flocks, this causes more anger towards them. People see them as <b>pests.</b></p>
                    <p>However, these pigeons rarely transmit diseases and are generally cleaner than most birds. Since they live near humans, their the perception of them being dirty is more on their environment instead of their lack of hygeine.</p>
                
                <h2>Issues They Face</h2>
                    <div class="list">

                                    <p>Pigeon's feet gets tangled in strings like hair, common strings, or fishing lines and more. This cuts circulation to their feet, which is why some pigeons you see in public may have missing toes or missing foot.</p>

                                <p>Human junk food, or most human food, are generally unhealthy for most birds.</p>
                                <p>Since pigeons forage for food from us humans, they may end up suffering from malnourishment or get digestive issues.</p>
                                <h5>How to prevent:</h5>
                                <p>Do not over order food and throw leftovers out or drop any.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Pigeons may end up drinking contaminated water in the cities.</p>
                                <h5>How to prevent:</h5>
                                <p>Avoid keeping contaminated water uncovered, put a lid over any unclean water source.</p>
                            </li>

                                <h4>Stress induced feather loss</h4>
                                <p>Pigeons may go through high stress at the environmental changes or overcrowding. This can lead to aggression, faster diseases transmission, feather plucking or weak chicks.</p>
                                <h5>How to prevent:</h5>
                                <p>Avoid preventing pigeons from nesting or making loud noises.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
